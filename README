The project contains a Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier. Gaussian means that the predictor variables (x1 ... xn) are all numeric data and that the distribution of each of the variables is normally distributed. 

Input:
filename: The name of the textfile containing the data.
isLast: true if the ground truth values of the dependent variable is in the last column.
delimitter: delimitter of the file. Usually "," for csv.
hasIndexCol: true if the data has an index column. That column is ignored in the learning.

Start:
Make an object of the class using the constructor and provide your inputs there. Call the run() method of the object.

Output:
To get a prediction, call the predict() method of the nbc object. The predict method takes a double[] as argument which is an array that has the values of the predictor variables in the same order as the learning data. This classifier does not support missing values.
The output will be a string which is the name of the category. Look at the example class for more info on the io.
